# C172 Instrument Panel

This folder contains the files and general information you'll need to build your C172's instrument panel itself.  
You'll find the following components here:

1. C172 Panel Template in PDF format.  Print this out as a multi-page document with Adobe Reader on regular 8 1/2 x 11 paper, with your paper size set to A0.  You can then tape these together for a complete template you can use to cut out your panel.
2. 3D printable instrument bezels.  These install into your panel from behind, and house the encoders for instruments that need them.  These encoders can then interface with Air Manager to allow you to adjust your altimeter and other gauges as you would in a real aircraft.
3. Wiring diagrams as required.

For your instrument panel, I recommend a 2' x 4' piece of 1/4" birch plywood.  It's smooth, cuts easily, and paints well. 

## Displaying Instruments with Air Manager

In my simulator, I created a support frame of 1/2" birch plywood that fits BEHIND the 1/4" panel.  This not only supports your panel, but also gives you a place to mount a standard display behind it.  Your front panel, with bezels, then fits over this display, and you display your Air Manager instruments by simply resizing them appropriately and moving them into the bezels on the panel.  This 1/2" support panel also provides a secure place to mount your radio stack and other controls.

See my overview video on my Youtube channel to give you an idea of how I put these together.  I'll also be adding more detailed info as I get things assembled.

**Happy building!**
