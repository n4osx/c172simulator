# Scott's Cessna 172 Home Simulator Repository
Greetings, fellow flight sim captains!

Some years ago, I embarked on a project to build a Cessna simulator so that I could enjoy flying virtually as well as
in real life.  As most do, my first simulator was desk-centric - just a few screens on a desk, with a joystick and 
rudder pedals.  Over time, this evolved into more complicated designs and versions, each one building on the one before it.

Here, you will find files and resources which I have used to develop version 3.0 of my current Cessna simulator.
It is a completely home-built, DIY project, incorporating items made from regular building materials as well as 
3D printed parts and components.  The electronics, while they might seem daunting to those are just embarking on
such a project, are actually quite simple as well and can easily be built by someone with a basic understanding
of the use of a soldering iron and a little basic wiring and electronics knowledge.

I have a Youtube channel which goes along with this repository, in which you will find an assortment of demonstration
and instructional videos as to how various components are constructed.  Please feel free to use these videos as
'how-to's' if you'd like to replicate something I've done, or just as inspiration to modify them to your own liking.

As this repository is just under construction, please bear with me as I get the resources assembled and uploaded 
over the next few weeks.

Good luck on your sim building journey - and happy flying! :)
