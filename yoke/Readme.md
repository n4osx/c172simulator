#3D Printed Yoke Notes and Instructions#

In this folder, you'll find the files for printing the control yoke you'll see in my simulator.  The yoke itself
is a design based on a Cessna 152 - I chose this primary because i found the design attractive, and it took up
a bit less space to give more room in the cockpit.  it also prints well, and is easy to assemble when complete
with a bit of 5-minute epoxy.

Files Required:

- C152 Yoke Back - Left.gcode
- C152 Yoke Back - Right.gcode
- C152 Yoke - Left Front.gcode
- C152 Yoke - Right Front.gcode

Suggestions for printing:

I printed these on my Ender 3 S1 Pro with no issues with common PLA filament.  
I recommend the following print settings:

- Print each section with the flat side down, of course.
- Brims were not needed, but I did use supports for the print surface only to provide a bit of support for the wire channels.
- 20-25% infill is recommended, as you will be tugging and pulling on these.

Assembly:

As noted above, if you get a good, clean print, nothing more than a bit of 5 minute two part epoxy is required to assemble
each half of the front and back of the yoke.  Small phillips sheet metal screws can be used to join the front and back.

Happy printing!
