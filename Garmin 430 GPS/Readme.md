# Garmin 430 GPS Unit #

Here, you'll find the STL 3D print files for the Garming 430 GPS unit.  When complete, this unit interfaces via the Arduino 2560 and Air Manager to allow you to control the 430 in your flight simulator.  This unit works great in both FS2020 and X-Plane 11 and 12.

Basic construction is identical to the Garmin 530 you'll also find in this repository.  See the more detailed instructions there for how to configure the buttons, encoders, and potentiometers you'll need to get this unit working.  These specific parts are also listed in the 530 instructions and where to get them.
